### <font color="#9900ffff">I</font>. Why I Decided to Develop a Tool for Juxtaposing Two Languages?

It aims to improve the efficiency of my daily tasks on translation since I have been working on it for more than 7 years (as of this writing); a gut feeling tells me "Time to convert my efforts into something more specific — or more financially rewarding :）" since this *** work drained too much of my time and energy. So I need a program to make things easier and more comfortable (at least for my mental health).

### <font color="#9900ffff">II</font>. Basic Functionality
Now then, there are plenty of rountine tasks as to how to standardise your translations and define the presence of a variety of phrases and expressions — an artistic equivalence to mathematics in STEM, I would say, why I've been asking for all of this?  Um, basically, it's part of my research and furthermore at its core & hub, however, which doesn't matter at all in this log — an odd fish in an odd barrel — Good. Allow me try to give an intro about fundamental functionality I need.

### 解决方法 (Solutions)
- 把 `1_Add_Entry.py`, `2_Bulk_Import.py`, `3_Search_Export.py` 移到 `pages/` 文件夹。
- 改文件名为纯英文/数字前缀，避免 emoji 文件名。

### 学到的东西 (Key learnings)
- Streamlit 多页面必须使用 `pages/` 文件夹。
- 数据层和 UI 分离，后续更容易迁移到 FastAPI。

### 下一步 (Next step)
- 完善 `Add_Entry` 页面，能保存数据到 SQLite。
- 尝试 `Bulk Import` 页面批量导入 CSV 数据。
